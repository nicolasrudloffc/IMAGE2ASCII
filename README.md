# IMAGE2ASCII
A simple tool to convert .png files to .txt in ASCII art!

It uses simple gray scaling and matrix conversion. Each element is then assessed and converted into an ASCII character. Then the matrix is transferred to "image.txt" and printed to the terminal.

## How to Use?
First, delete image.png and copy in the image you want to convert. Change the filename of the image to "image.png". The image must be a png. Run main.py and the image will be converted to ASCII. The output is printed to the terminal and stored in "image.txt".

Enjoy!
